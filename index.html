            <p>Choosing the right financial advisor is one of the most important financial decisions you'll make. Whether you're looking for a fiduciary, a fee-only advisor, or someone with real investment management experience, these five criteria &mdash; ranked in order of importance &mdash; will help you find an advisor you can trust with your financial future.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Criterion 1 -->
        <article class="criterion">
            <button class="criterion-header" aria-expanded="true">
                <span class="criterion-number">1</span>

                    <h2>Is the advisor a fiduciary?</h2>
                    <p class="criterion-summary">Must be a yes for all parts of the relationship, especially investment management.</p>
                </div>

            </button>
            <div class="criterion-body">
                <p>Having a fiduciary is the most important aspect of a relationship with an advisor. Advisors who are not fiduciaries have perfected describing their situation and how they can still take just as good care of their clients &mdash; it's a lie.</p>
                <p>Sadly, it is possible for an advisor to be a fiduciary for only certain parts of the relationship, such as financial planning, but not for the most important part, investing your money.</p>
                <p>Brokers who work for Ameriprise Financial, Merrill Lynch, Fidelity, Charles Schwab, Edward Jones, Raymond James, and many others are not required to be fiduciaries. Instead, they owe what is called a &ldquo;duty of suitability&rdquo; to their clients, which means they are only required to suggest investment products suitable for an investor but are not required to give advice or recommend investments in the investor's best interest. Brokers are &ldquo;registered representatives,&rdquo; and that is not the same as being a Registered Investment Advisor &mdash; the terms are very similar, but they mean very different things. Brokers might call themselves &ldquo;advisors,&rdquo; but they act as agents for their brokerage firm and typically earn commissions.</p>
                <div class="takeaway">
                    <strong>Bottom line:</strong> Avoid the &ldquo;drive-through&rdquo; brokers who are not required to be fiduciaries.

            <div class="criterion-body">
                <p>Would someone prefer a salesperson or an advisor? Simply put, if an advisor can earn commissions in any way there is a barrier between the desired outcome of maximizing wealth. This is because the advisor is motivated to put clients in an inferior investment due to commission paid while shunning a better investment choice that doesn't have commission.</p>
                <p>This is not a joke: most advisors that sell insurance have this exact quote in the documents that they must give a client:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    &ldquo;These professionals therefore have incentive to recommend insurance products based on the compensation to be received, rather than on a client's needs. The receipt of additional fees for insurance commissions is therefore a conflict of interest, and clients should be aware of this conflict when considering whether to engage or utilize these professionals to implement any insurance recommendations.&rdquo;
